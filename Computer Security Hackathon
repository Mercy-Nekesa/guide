COMPUTER SECURITY HACKATHON
Date: Saturday, 14th March 2014
Time: 8.00am –
Venue: Science Building, LT3
Price: FREE

Description
In order to stop bad guys from causing disruption and chaos, one must know their methods and mentalities , then find a way to mitigate those loop holes. With ‘Capture the Flag’ (CTF), we hope to bring an environment where one can learn just that. We hope to bring innovation across cyber-security and stop cyber-attacks. Developers participating in this hackathon will (if not yet) learn to create a cyber-security product, or a product that has security at core. 
This event targets student hackers, ICT professionals (if any) and enthusiasts.
Presentation
1.	Cyber security concepts
2.	Ways to detect threats and attacks
3.	And best practices to mitigate risks.
Guidelines
1.	One must be a USIU student to be eligible to participate.
2.	A team should comprise of maximum participants of 3.
3.	Identify a number of flags/vulnerabilities/strategic points setup by ‘us (organizers)’.
4.	A team could also identify a security weakness in a product built by the developers and present their findings (optional).
5.	Participants will connect to a wireless network and LAN with a virtual infrastructure. This includes:
o	Domains, 
o	Linux systems, 
o	Windows systems, 
o	Web applications, and everything in between. 

The participants will be required to break into the systems and gain access to flags. These flags will then be inputted into the Capture The Flag (CTF) scoreboard for appropriate tracking. 


6.	Participants can ONLY attack the capture the flag network.

7.	Maximum time to complete the challenges is 5 hours.

8.	Participants should bring their own device

9.	Have their workstation equipped with pre-defined hacking tools and a usable kali Linux.


Demos
After the intensive hacking, the teams will be given a maximum time of 6 min to Demo their findings and present solutions to mitigate the breaches.
Questions and comments will be done after the team’s Demo.

Judging
Teams will be Judged on the number of vulnerabilities discovered and provision of ways to secure the loop holes.
