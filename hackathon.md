#### What is hackathon?

An event, typically lasting several days, in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming.


#### Our goals?

- Building a developer community within campus.
- Create a hackathon (events) culture at the USIU.
- Mentor younger hackers; mentor/ mentee program.
- Build teams/ team building: Get our team to work with others that they may not regularly work with.
Creative output: Give everyone the opportunity to get away from their desks and daily tasks to squeeze out their creative juices.
- Product development: Create working products or services.


#### What do I get?

- A shirt :)
- Snacks and Drinks.
- You get to meet other developers and techies.


#### Hackathon Guidelines

- Coding must take place during designated programming hours. No outside work allowed.
- Each team gets 5 minutes to present their project (max).
- Each project must be solving a problem identified in any area.
- Bring your own device (BYOD) laptop, tablet, testing device.
- We encourage teams to be composed of two to five people - you need a good reason to be work alone (optional).
- If and when voting occurs, each team must cast votes for ANOTHER team. No self-voting allowed! (for the audience choice award).
- Upon judging, no complaints can be made whatsoever: there choice is final.There will howerver be an audience choice.
- Participation awards - recognition on site with products.
- Short demo and presentation, 5 slides max, 5 mins max. Master pitching.
- No running torrents within the network or unnecessarily deteriorating the network.


#### How to survive a hackathon

- Have a modest goal; a simple concept or app to build. Do one thing and do it well, concentrate on building a prototype, not a finished product!. Build something simple. A finished product is better than one that can't compile.
- Get enough rest, stay hydrated and just relax. (relax, take it easy - Mika)
- Set your tools - sublime text, netbeans, Jetbrains, VIM, Emacs ... etc your compilers and get your coding mojo.
- Clean your comp, fine tune it - make it fast.


#### Expectations

To get involved more in the tech community
Classical Music? Sprints - short

#### Have an Idea? / Do I need to be a programmer?


#### Venue?
- School of Science Building - microphone, speakers - sockets - LT3
- cabling/ reliable WiFi


#### Who will attend? (must be USIU student)
- USIU students - hackers, ideaters a like
- Techies
- 

#### Pitching session (optional - to create teams)

- Pitch your idea to the attendees.
- Pitching takes 3 mins max - no slides no powerpoint!
- Get to know members and form teams.
- If you dont have a team, listen to the pitches and join a team with a problem solving idea that interested you.


### Demos

Get your judges ready, call everybody back into the main room, and get ready for teams to show off their work.

- Each team should receive between three and five minutes to describe their problem, how they intended to solve it, and demo what they came up with. Make sure teams know that it’s a hard limit, and don’t be afraid to cut off teams that go long.
- It’s up to you whether or not to allow Q&A, which tends to consume a lot of time. For larger events, it’s often better to ask people to save questions for later, or only allow the judges to ask questions.
- Keep things moving. Part of the competition is being able to concisely describe what you did.


#### Judging criteria/ Scoring


With such an appealing grand prize on the line, we wanted to make sure that the judging criteria was as transparent and fair as possible. Given the time constraints and available resources, teams were not required to have a working demo for their product. Instead, everyone was given the breakdown of exactly what the scoring sheet would look like, so that they could plan their presentations accordingly:

## 60% of the score is calculated from peer scores:

### 25% – Real World Application

Does this product identify a real need, demand, or problem?
Does this product solve the identified need, demand, or problem?

### 25% – Concreteness

Does the team identify clear customer segment(s)?
Does the team present the Unique Value Proposition(s) clearly and effectively?
Does the team effectively use channels to acquire new users and customers?
Does the team present a strategy for customer relationships and retention?
Overall, does the team thoroughly and persuasively present the product/service?

### 10% – Uniqueness

Is this idea a creative or new solution to a need or problem?
Does the product innovate on AT LEAST ONE of the following?
(a) features
(b) design
(c) user interactions
(d) technical solutions

### 40% of the score is calculated from our two CEOs’ scores:

### 20% – Possibility and Feasibility

Is it possible to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within 3 months?
Is it a stand alone product that can be built with our own resources? Or does it require other contributing partners to complete the product?

### 20% – Teamwork

Did each team member participate?
Does the team clearly demonstrate each member’s roles and responsibilities (R&R)?


#### Feedback

feedback? - collection of feedback from the web app.


#### Post-Event Follow Up

After the event, follow up with an email to all attendees thanking them for their attendance. Make sure you provide information about any follow-up events that might occur, such as future hackathons, meet-ups, or awards events.


#### Schedule

The hackathon should last just under 10 hours. Not a lot of time, admittedly, but having a tighter deadline will make teams much more productive!
